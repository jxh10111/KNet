KNet is a web-based application designed for high-throughput virtual screening of small molecules across the human kinome. 

KNet is hosted on an internal server with 8 GPUs. The KNet system consists of a frontend user interface and the backend prediction server. The user interface allows users to input chemical structures and retrieve predictions, while the prediction server runs the multi-task deep neural network (MTDNN) models. 

The KNet server is freely accessible at https://knet.idsc.miami.edu/.
